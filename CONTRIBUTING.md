# Contributing
Bugcrowd welcomes community feedback and direct contributions to the Bugcrowd VRT. We accept comments for public discussion via GitHub Issues, but can also accommodate comments made via email to [vrt@bugcrowd.com](mailto:vrt@bugcrowd.com).

## Process
Please open your feedback as an **Issue** and label it as either a `bug` or an `enhancement`. The Bugcrowd team strives to review and comment on new Issues within three business days. Large or systemic changes should first be discussed in an Issue rather than be submitted as a pull request directly. If you have a suggested minor change that includes:

- Additional subcategories or variants
- Rewording of existing entries
- Corrections of typographical or other minor errors

you may open a pull request directly for these examples. Prior to opening a pull request please ensure your suggested changes pass schema validation. The repository includes a `validate-vrt.py` script that can be used to perform JSON validation using `vrt-schema.json` (see examples below).

### Example Git Hook Validation
1. Install `jsonschema` via pip with `pip install jsonschema`
 - If you don't have pip, you can install it like so: `easy_install pip`
2. Add a pre-commit hook that will automatically run the validation script every time you run `git commit`
 - Windows: `mklink /H .git\hooks\pre-commit validate-vrt.py`
 - Linux/macOS: `ln -s ../../validate-vrt.py .git/hooks/pre-commit`

### Example Manual JSON validation
 1. Install `jsonschema` via pip with `pip install jsonschema`
  - If you don't have pip, you can install it like so: `easy_install pip`
 2. Run `validate-vrt.py`
