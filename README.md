# VRT
The main repository for tracking additions and modifications to Bugcrowd's VRT.

## Background

### History
Previously, the Technical Operations team maintained its collective vulnerability priority rating knowledge as a shared document. Once we adopted the vulnerability rating taxonomy (VRT) model, however, we moved to using a series of shared spreadsheets. These were both quick and dirty solutions that worked with a small number of maintainers, but the current format won't scale well as Bugcrowd grows.

As a result, it makes sense to start using real version control. This will allow a system of pull requests, discussions, and issues that we can use to formalize the VRT's evolutionary process at a larger scale.

Initially, this repository will only contain a JSON file representing the entirety of the data within version 0.2.0. Moving forward, we will need to develop a front end tool for navigating and searching through this data.

### Process
Each week, the Technical Operations team already meets for a "Vulnerability Roundtable" where we discuss potential changes or additions to the VRT. Leveraging this meeting, instead of discussing items on a "pending" spreadsheet or making informal suggestions for additions or modifications, we can simply discuss pull requests.

By using pull requests, our Roundtable meeting will be significantly more organized and efficient. Initial discussions can happen online within these pull requests before we discuss them at the Roundtable, thus saving time each week.

Once the team agrees on a particular addition or change (decided at the Roundtable), a maintainer will merge the pull request. This will prevent accidental or disagreeable changes and will allow us to track changes (including discussions) over time.

When you want to make edits to the VRT, you should validate your changes against our schema, so that you always know it's correct.

There's a small upfront setup process:

1. Install `jsonschema` via pip with `pip install jsonschema`
 - If you don't have pip, install it like so `sudo easy_install pip`
2. Make your changes to the VRT, save, then run `python validate-vrt.py` to validate the changes

Of course tooling around validating the schema is completely up to each person. You may use a JSON validation plugin for your favorite editor, but any changes MUST pass `python validate-vrt.py` before being merged.

## General Guidelines
- If you want to pitch a new idea, feel free to create a new **Issue** any time. Make sure to label it as a `bug` or `enhancement`, but don't worry about the other fields.
- If you want to actually propose a change, create a **Pull Request** by following the Contributor Guidelines. Remember that any large/systemic changes should first be discussed via an Issue.
- All minor Pull Requests need at least **two** unique reviewers aside from the author, and any large or final "just before non-RC release" Pull Requests need at least **five** unique reviewers aside from the author.
- **Above all, the VRT is designed to be a democratic multi-party effort. Members of the Technical Operations team are expected to not only discuss ideas via Issues, but discuss and occasionally propose Pull Requests. All other Bugcrowd employees are free to participate as well.**

- **subcategory**: the vulnerability's common name
- **variant**: the subcase of the common vulnerability, i.e. the specific function or type (used when different variants do not have the same priority)
- **priority**: the Bugcrowd priority value, representing the approximate technical impact of the vulnerability
	- **P1**: critical
	- **P2**: high
	- **P3**: medium
	- **P4**: low
	- **P5**: wontfix
